[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/vigdail/raytracer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/vigdail/raytracer)

Simple raytracer made in Rust.

Written by this awesome [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial.

## Run

Release version is much faster than debug. So prefer to run release.

```code
cargo run --release
```
